## Copy and paste this template into ChatGPT:

```
I'm learning backend development by building a Multi-Agent Document Intelligence System (DocuMind AI). I'm working on [SPECIFIC TOPIC/CONCEPT YOU'RE STUCK ON].

**My Project Context:**
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Google Gemini API, ChromaDB, CrewAI
- Project Structure: FastAPI backend with RAG pipeline and multi-agent system
- Current Stage: [Week 1 / Week 2 / etc.] - [What you're working on]

**What I Need Help With:**
[Describe your specific question or confusion]

**What I've Already Tried/Understood:**
[Briefly mention what you know or what you've attempted]

**My Learning Goal:**
I want to understand [CONCEPT] deeply so I can:
1. Explain it in interviews
2. Implement it correctly in my project
3. Understand why we use this approach

**Please:**
1. Explain the concept in simple terms (I'm a beginner)
2. Give a real-world analogy if possible
3. Show a simple code example
4. Explain how it relates to my project
5. Suggest any resources (docs/videos) for deeper learning

Thank you!
```

## Example Usage:

### Example 1: Understanding Pydantic Settings
```
I'm learning backend development by building a Multi-Agent Document Intelligence System (DocuMind AI). I'm working on Pydantic Settings for configuration management.

**My Project Context:**
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Google Gemini API, ChromaDB, CrewAI
- Project Structure: FastAPI backend with RAG pipeline and multi-agent system
- Current Stage: Week 1 - Setting up configuration management

**What I Need Help With:**
I don't understand why we use `BaseSettings` from pydantic-settings instead of just reading .env files directly with python-dotenv. What's the difference and why is BaseSettings better?

**What I've Already Tried/Understood:**
I know we need to store API keys in .env files for security, but I'm confused about the Pydantic part.

**My Learning Goal:**
I want to understand configuration management deeply so I can:
1. Explain it in interviews
2. Implement it correctly in my project
3. Understand why we use this approach

**Please:**
1. Explain the concept in simple terms (I'm a beginner)
2. Give a real-world analogy if possible
3. Show a simple code example
4. Explain how it relates to my project
5. Suggest any resources (docs/videos) for deeper learning

Thank you!
```

### Example 2: Understanding FastAPI Async
```
I'm learning backend development by building a Multi-Agent Document Intelligence System (DocuMind AI). I'm working on FastAPI async/await patterns.

**My Project Context:**
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Google Gemini API, ChromaDB, CrewAI
- Project Structure: FastAPI backend with RAG pipeline and multi-agent system
- Current Stage: Week 1 - Creating FastAPI endpoints

**What I Need Help With:**
What does `async def` mean in FastAPI? When should I use it vs regular `def`? How does it make my API faster?

**What I've Already Tried/Understood:**
I understand basic Python functions, but async/await is new to me.

**My Learning Goal:**
I want to understand async programming deeply so I can:
1. Explain it in interviews
2. Implement it correctly in my project
3. Understand why we use this approach

**Please:**
1. Explain the concept in simple terms (I'm a beginner)
2. Give a real-world analogy if possible
3. Show a simple code example
4. Explain how it relates to my project
5. Suggest any resources (docs/videos) for deeper learning

Thank you!

## Tips for Using This Prompt:

1. **Be Specific**: Replace [SPECIFIC TOPIC] with exactly what you're confused about
2. **Update Context**: Keep the project context updated as you progress
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Don't hesitate to ask "Can you explain that part again?" or "Can you give another example?"
4. **Request Examples**: Always ask for code examples related to YOUR project structure
5. **Interview Prep**: Ask "How would I explain this in an interview?" at the end

## When to Use This:

- ✅ When you don't understand a concept from homework
- ✅ When you're stuck on implementation
- ✅ When you need deeper explanation than what we covered
- ✅ When you want interview talking points
- ✅ When you need code examples for your specific use case
